This project applies user-based collaborative filtering to build a movie recommender system using the MovieLens dataset. It begins with essential data preprocessing using pandas, merging user ratings with movie titles to create a unified dataset. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques were applied to understand the distribution of average ratings and the number of ratings per movie, using visualizations created with matplotlib and seaborn. A user-item interaction matrix was constructed using a pivot table, mapping each user's ratings to corresponding movies. The core recommendation logic is based on Pearson correlation, computed between movies to identify those with similar rating patterns among users. To ensure meaningful correlations, results are filtered to include only movies with more than 100 ratings, preventing skew from sparsely rated titles. The project emphasizes key concepts from recommender systems, including similarity measurement, collaborative filtering, sparse data handling, and cold start mitigation through minimum rating thresholds. This end-to-end workflow showcases how real-world recommendation engines can be implemented with basic machine learning principles and data science tools
